# Medical Insurance Premium Prediction App  

This repository contains an interactive Streamlit-based web application designed to predict medical insurance premiums using Machine Learning models. The project leverages multiple ML algorithms and provides insights into model performance through comparison graphs. Users can input relevant details (such as age, BMI, and more) and get real-time premium predictions based on the trained model.
