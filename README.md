# 🏥 Medical Insurance Premium Prediction App

This repository contains an interactive **Streamlit-based web application** designed to predict medical insurance premiums using **Machine Learning models**. The project leverages multiple ML algorithms and provides insights into model performance through comparison graphs. Users can input relevant details (such as age, BMI, and more) and get real-time premium predictions based on the trained model.

## 🌟 Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**:  
  Built with Streamlit, the app offers a simple and interactive UI for a seamless user experience.

- **📈 Model Comparison**:  
  Includes a comprehensive comparison of ML models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, etc.) to showcase performance metrics like R² scores.

- **Interactive Visualizations**:  
  Graphs and charts comparing untuned and tuned model performances to highlight improvements.
